/**
 * Exercise 17:   (2) Create a class with a constructor that takes a String argument. During
 *                    construction, print the argument. Create an array of object references to this class, but donâ€™t
 *                    actually create objects to assign into the array. When you run the program, notice whether
 *                    the initialization messages from the constructor calls are printed.
 * Exercise 18:   (1) Complete the previous exercise by creating objects to attach to the array
 *                    of references.
